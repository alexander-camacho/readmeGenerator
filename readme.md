## Installation
Enter the following command into the command line to install dependencies: ```npm i```

## Usage
This project is used entirely within the command line. After the dependencies are installed using npm i the project will be able to be ran calling node index.js. This will begin the program which is a series of questions to be answered that will fill in a few basic sections of a README.md file. All questions are able to be answered within the command line by simply typing a response, or selecting a response from a list where applicable. Once the final question is answered a new README.md file will be created. All of the data that was entered will be placed into the appropriate sections within the README.md file, as well as a table of contents that will move the viewport down to each section when clicked.
