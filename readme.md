## Installation
Enter the following command into the command line to install dependencies: ```npm i```

## Usage
This project is used entirely within the command line. After the dependencies are installed using ```npm i``` the project will be able to be ran by calling ```node index.js```. 

This will begin the program which is a series of questions to be answered that will fill in a few basic sections of a README file. All questions are able to be answered within the command line by simply typing a response, or selecting a response from a list where applicable. 

Once the final question is answered a new README file will be created and placed into the main directory that contains index.js. All of the data that was entered will be placed into the appropriate sections within the README file, and a table of contents will be generated.

The repository contains a sample.md file that was generated using this app.
